# Turtlesim PID Controllers

### Python Code Overview

The basic structure of both scripts is as follows:

- A class `turtleBotThingieClass` to make the code Object Oriented
- Constructor function to initialise the `Subscriber` and `Publisher` objects and ******create****** the `rosnode`
- A getter function `turtle_pos_updater` to get the live position of the Turtle by ***********subscribing*********** to the `/turtle1/pose` topic
- Error functions to calculate the difference between ******desired****** and *******current******* value
- Finally, a setter function `mover` which *********publishes********* the data onto the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic to which the Turtle is subscribed

In general it is a good habit to make this script object oriented by using classes as this allows the user to create multiple nodes if needed

### Normal Steering Mechanism

Basic principle is similar to driving a car, which moves forward/backward along with turning, rather than turn in place before moving forward

The `angle_steer_error` is used to measure the error in angle between the turtleâ€™s current facing direction to the one it is supposed to face, basically aligning it to where its supposed to go

The `position_error` measures the error in the linear distance between the current and final position of the turtle

Using both of them simultaneously gives a smooth ********steering******** curve, the radius and *******smoothness******* of which can be controlled by altering the PID constants

### Turn and Drive Mechanism

It uses the same functions as above, simply the order is changed

First the alignment is done to ****face**** the final direction, without any linear movement; then the linear movement is done, but the PID for angular error is not taken out of the equation due to error large distances
